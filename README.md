# Commit good practices
-----------------------

## Overview
When working on a project, it's important to keep a clear and organized history of changes made. This can be achieved through good commit practices, such as writing clear and descriptive commit messages and using tags to categorize changes. Here are some best practices for committing:

1. Keep commit messages short and descriptive, using imperative phrases.
2. Use commit tags to categorize the changes made in the commit.
3. Write clear and precise commit messages that describe the changes made.
4. Separate tag information from the rest of the commit message using colons.
5. Use only the necessary tags to categorize the changes made in the commit.
6. Make frequent and small commits to maintain a clear and traceable history of changes.

## Commit Tags
Here are some common tags that can be used to categorize changes made in a commit:

### feat
Use this tag when adding a new feature to the project.

Example: `feat: add functionality for password reset`

### fix
Use this tag when fixing a bug or error in the project.

Example: `fix: fix application crash on startup in certain environments`

### docs
Use this tag when making changes to documentation or adding new documentation to the project.

Example: `docs: update API endpoints documentation with examples and additional information`

### style
Use this tag when making changes to the style of the code, such as formatting or whitespace.

Example: `style: refactor code to comply with coding style guidelines`

### refactor
Use this tag when refactoring code to improve its maintainability or efficiency.

Example: `refactor: refactor tax calculation algorithm for improved maintainability`

### test
Use this tag when adding or modifying tests for the project.

Example: `test: add unit tests for user registration and login processes`

### chore
Use this tag when making changes to project configuration or build tools.

Example: `chore: update project dependencies and build tools`

### ci
Use this tag when making changes to the project's continuous integration pipeline or configuration.

Example: `ci: configure build pipeline to deploy to staging environment on each push to main branch`

### perf
Use this tag when making changes to improve the performance of the project.

Example: `perf: optimize database queries to improve application performance`

### revert
Use this tag when reverting a previous commit.

Example: `revert: revert last commit that introduced a critical issue in production`

### cleanup
Use this tag when removing unused code or files from the project.

Example: `cleanup: remove unused code and files from the project`

### data
Use this tag when adding or modifying database-related code or scripts.

Example: `data: add database migration scripts to support new data models`

### security
Use this tag when making changes to improve the security of the project.

Example: `security: update authentication and authorization mechanisms to use more secure protocols and encryption algorithms`

### hotfix
Use this tag when fixing a critical security vulnerability or issue.

Example: `hotfix: fix critical security vulnerability that allows unauthorized access to sensitive data`

Remember to adapt these commit practices to fit the specific needs and conventions of your project. By using clear and descriptive commit messages and properly tagging changes, you can create a clear and organized history of changes made to your project.
